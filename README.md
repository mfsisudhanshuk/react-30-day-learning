## Useref


The useRef hook in React is a versatile and powerful tool that allows you to manage mutable references to elements or values without triggering re-renders. It is primarily used for accessing the DOM directly, storing mutable variables across renders, and maintaining references to values or elements.

### These examples demonstrate the versatility and importance of `useRef` in React applications. It's particularly useful for:

1. Direct DOM manipulation without causing re-renders
2. Storing mutable values that persist across renders
3. Keeping track of values from previous renders
4. Managing timers and intervals efficiently
